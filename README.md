# Craiglist-Django

The idea is to enable the website https://saltlakecity.craigslist.org/ with a neater and more user-friendly frontend using MaterializeCSS.

When you go into the website, type an item to look for (e.g. 'bike', 'lenovo', etc) and the items will be displayed nicely with 
card images. You can click on them to be redirected to the original item in Craiglist SLC.

# Main challenges of the web-app:

- Display nicely the Craiglist items using MaterializeCSS
- Webscraping using BeautifulSoup.
